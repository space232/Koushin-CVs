# Koushin-CVs
| Current Versions for Koushin Update Mod.

This is a public repository which keeps track of the current up-to-date modpack versions.
It is useless on it's own, but is used by the [Koushin](https://github.com/owospace/Koushin) mod.

## Why?
 - To keep track of the up-to-date versions.
 - To allow clients to be notified of updates via [Koushin](https://github.com/owospace/Koushin)
 - Because I wanted to make life easier for myself and others.

## Frequently Asked Questions

"Can I use this in my modpack?"  
- What? Why? This is literally a `.txt/.json` file.

## I have a concern/request/idea.
